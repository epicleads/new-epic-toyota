## ✅ **IMPLEMENTED - Technical SEO (Google Search Console Compliant)**

### 🔧 **Page Optimization**
- ✅ Title: "Epic Toyota Chennai - #1 Authorized Dealer Mount Road & Vyasarpadi | Latest Offers 2025"
- ✅ Description: Dealer + Showroom + Offers focus (comprehensive search coverage)
- ✅ Keywords: 60+ keywords (dealer, showroom, offers, models, service, financial, exchange)
- ✅ Structured Data: `AutomotiveDealer` schema (LEAD GENERATION - not e-commerce)
- ✅ Hidden SEO Content: H1/H2 focused on offers while maintaining dealer authority

### 📊 **Schema Markup (Google Ads & Search Console Compliant)**

**🚨 IMPORTANT: NO PRODUCT SCHEMAS** - Avoids Merchant Center requirements

```json
{
  "@type": "AutomotiveDealer" - Lead generation business (NOT product store)
  "makesOffer": [
    Service-based offers (Test Drive, Exchange, Financing)
    NO product prices (avoids merchant feed errors)
  ],
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "ReserveAction" - Lead generation (NOT BuyAction)
  }
}
```

**✅ What We Use**:
- AutomotiveDealer (main business entity)
- LocalBusiness (local SEO)
- WebPage (informational content)
- Review on AutomotiveDealer (NOT on Product)
- Service-based Offers (no product pricing)
