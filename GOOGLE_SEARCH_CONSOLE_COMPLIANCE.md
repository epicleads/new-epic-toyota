# Google Search Console & Google Ads Compliance Guide

## ‚úÖ COMPLIANCE STATUS: AUTOMOTIVE LEAD GENERATION SITE

This website is configured as an **Automotive Dealer Lead Generation Site** - NOT an e-commerce/product listing site. This prevents Google Merchant Center errors and ensures proper validation in Google Search Console and Google Ads.

---

## üéØ What We Fixed

### ‚ùå REMOVED (Causes Merchant Center Issues)
1. **Product Schema** - Removed from ReviewsStructuredData.tsx
2. **AggregateOffer Schema** - No pricing data that triggers product feed requirements
3. **OfferCatalog Schema** - Replaced with service-based offers
4. **itemScope/itemType microdata** on sections - Removed Product, PromotionalOffer types
5. **Individual Offer schemas with Car items** - Replaced with service offerings

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (Automotive Industry Compliant)
1. **AutomotiveDealer Schema** - Primary organization type
2. **LocalBusiness Schema** - For local SEO
3. **Service-Based Offers** - Test drives, financing, exchange programs (no product prices)
4. **Review Schema** - Attached to AutomotiveDealer (not Product)
5. **WebPage Schema** - Informational content (not commercial product listing)
6. **ReserveAction** - Lead generation actions (test drive bookings)

## üìä Current Structured Data Architecture

### 1. **AutomotiveDealer** (Main Business Entity)
```json
{
  "@type": "AutomotiveDealer",
  "name": "Epic Toyota Chennai",
  "brand": { "@type": "Brand", "name": "Toyota" },
  "makesOffer": [
    { "@type": "Offer", "name": "Test Drive Booking", "category": "Service" },
    { "@type": "Offer", "name": "Vehicle Exchange Program", "category": "Service" },
    { "@type": "Offer", "name": "Financing Assistance", "category": "Service" }
  ],
  "potentialAction": { "@type": "ReserveAction" }
}
```
**Purpose**: Identifies the business as an automotive dealer with service offerings (not product sales)

### 2. **LocalBusiness** (Local SEO)
```json
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Epic Toyota Chennai",
  "address": {...},
  "geo": {...},
  "openingHoursSpecification": [...]
}
```
**Purpose**: Local search visibility without triggering product feed requirements

### 3. **WebPage** (Informational Content)
```json
{
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "about": { "@type": "AutomotiveDealer" },
  "inLanguage": "en-IN"
}
```
**Purpose**: Marks page as informational/editorial content, not a product catalog

### 4. **Reviews on AutomotiveDealer** (NOT Product)
```json
{
  "@type": "AutomotiveDealer",
  "aggregateRating": {...},
  "review": [
    {
      "@type": "Review",
      "itemReviewed": { "@type": "AutomotiveDealer" }
    }
  ]
}
```
**Purpose**: Reviews for the dealer business, not for products (avoids review snippet errors)

### 5. **FAQPage, WebSite, Service** (Supporting Schemas)
All properly configured in StructuredData.tsx component

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå DON'T Add These Schemas (Will Trigger Merchant Issues)
1. **Product Schema with Offers**
   ```json
   // ‚ùå BAD - Triggers product feed requirement
   {
     "@type": "Product",
     "name": "Toyota Fortuner",
     "offers": {
       "@type": "Offer",
       "price": "3500000",
       "priceCurrency": "INR"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **AggregateOffer on Products**
   ```json
   // ‚ùå BAD - Requires Merchant Center feed
   {
     "@type": "Product",
     "offers": {
       "@type": "AggregateOffer",
       "lowPrice": "500000",
       "highPrice": "8000000"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **OfferCatalog with Product Items**
   ```json
   // ‚ùå BAD - Google expects a product feed
   {
     "@type": "OfferCatalog",
     "itemListElement": [
       {
         "@type": "Offer",
         "itemOffered": { "@type": "Car" }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Review on Product**
   ```json
   // ‚ùå BAD - Reviews on products need product data
   {
     "@type": "Product",
     "review": [...]
   }
   ```

### ‚úÖ DO Use These Instead (Automotive Lead Generation)
1. **Service-Based Offers**
   ```json
   // ‚úÖ GOOD - Service offering, not product sale
   {
     "@type": "AutomotiveDealer",
     "makesOffer": [
       {
         "@type": "Offer",
         "name": "Test Drive Booking",
         "category": "Service",
         "description": "Book a free test drive"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **ReserveAction for Lead Generation**
   ```json
   // ‚úÖ GOOD - Action-based, not purchase-based
   {
     "@type": "ReserveAction",
     "target": { "@type": "EntryPoint" },
     "result": { "@type": "Reservation" }
   }
   ```

3. **Reviews on AutomotiveDealer**
   ```json
   // ‚úÖ GOOD - Business reviews
   {
     "@type": "AutomotiveDealer",
     "review": [
       {
         "@type": "Review",
         "itemReviewed": { "@type": "AutomotiveDealer" }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## üéì Key Principles

### 1. **Lead Generation ‚â† E-commerce**
- You're generating leads for showroom visits
- Not selling products online with shopping carts
- Structured data should reflect this distinction

### 2. **Service Offers ‚â† Product Offers**
- "Test Drive Booking" is a service
- "Buy Toyota Fortuner ‚Çπ35L" is a product
- Always frame as services, not products

### 3. **Reviews on Business ‚â† Reviews on Products**
- Reviews for Epic Toyota Chennai (business)
- NOT reviews for Toyota Fortuner (product)
- This prevents product feed requirements

### 4. **Informational ‚â† Transactional**
- Content is informational (learn about offers)
- NOT transactional (buy now with price)
- Google treats these differently

---

## üö® Common Errors & Fixes

### Error: "Missing field 'offers.price'"
**Cause**: Google thinks you're listing products for sale

**Fix**: Remove Product schema, use AutomotiveDealer with service-based makesOffer

### Error: "Review must have itemReviewed"
**Cause**: Review not properly attached to entity

**Fix**: Ensure itemReviewed is AutomotiveDealer, not Product

### Error: "AggregateOffer requires product feed"
**Cause**: Using AggregateOffer on Product schema

**Fix**: Remove Product schema entirely, use service offerings

### Warning: "Price missing in Offer"
**Cause**: Offer schema without price (when attached to Product)

**Fix**: Change Offer to service-based (no price needed)

---
